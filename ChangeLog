	* Modify readsym() to be able to parse linux's three field
	  /boot/System.map format, while retaining the ability to
	  parse the two field /proc/ksyms format.
	* Who doesn't have perl in /usr/bin these days?
	  update pstruct (probably no better than the one in /usr/bin)
	  update mk_kme_defs
	* Add NOTE for using pstruct with newer gcc to README.mk_kme_defs

2004-05-12	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add 1st cut of kmed manual page.  Improvements forthcoming.

2004-04-28	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add -D to the list of options saved with the 's' command.  Also,
	  save the -d and the -D options only if they have changed from
	  the defaults.

2004-04-26	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Really gut the old read_mem()/wite_mem() code, and implement
	  both fixed and floating mmap() capability in addition to
	  the standard lseek/read/write method.

2004-04-22	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add mmap capability to kmed.  This is selected with the
	  corefile syntax: -c device,0xADDR,0xSIZE

2004-04-21	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add -d to the list of options saved with 's' command.  Put escaped
	  newlines into the saved file for easier editing/viewing.

2004-04-20	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Default rw_max to 128.  This avoids a bug where a rw packet with
	  size 0 would be sent if the very first display format used any
	  of the indirection operators.

2004-04-17	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add -r (readonly) flag to kmed and error message if corefile
	  cannot be opened.  Add -D (debug level) flag to kmed.

2002-10-27	Rick Richardson <rickr@mn.rr.com
	* Add -g command line option and GDB remote serial protocol.

2001-06-03	Gene Olson et al
	* This is the first truly public release of KME.
