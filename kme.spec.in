%Description
KME is the Kernel Memory Editor.  Like many useful programs, it has outgrown
it's name and now allows semi-realtime symbolic editing of process memory,
kernel memory, in-circuit emulators, and has ioctl hooks to talk to many Digi
Int'l devices.

KME excels at allowing you to walk through memory in a symbolic manner.  It
knows about arrays, letting you traverse them with a single keystroke.  If
you're trying to watch a buffer in semi-realtime, KME is the tool.

It is portable to almost any existing UNIX derivate and CPU architecture.
